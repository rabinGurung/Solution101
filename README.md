# Solution
 This is the solution demo to the candidate scenario problem.
# Manual
 First given number was {50,51,52,53,54} I assumed the number was already given to the  memory so I created a final static array of int.
Then I instantiated the int n to tract the time.
After that since you had provide the dashboard value to be {value1, value2, value3, value4, value2}, the new dashboard number would be {50,51,52,53,51}
After that I created timer scheduler.
The timer scheduler would run for every 5 seconds.
Every the values are changed, the value would be printed and checked lineary if any value would be smaller than 15 or greater than 35.
If the value is either smaller than 15 or greater than 35 then a alert message would be printed with value item.
If the timer is at 120 seconds or the value of n is greater than 23 then the task would terminate.
